            Stack Overflow is for <span class="revision-comment">professional and enthusiast programmers</span>,
            people who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow questions
            have a bit of <b>source code</b> in them, but if your question generally covers &hellip;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a specific programming problem</li>
            <li>a software algorithm</li>
            <li>software tools commonly used by programmers</li>
            <li>practical, answerable problems that are <i>unique</i> to the programming profession</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        &hellip; then you&rsquo;re in the right place to ask your question!

    <p id="link-ask">
    Please <a href="/search">look around</a> to see if your question has been asked

            You should only ask <span class="revision-comment">practical, answerable questions based
            on actual problems that you face</span>. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish
            the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.
            </p>
            <p>
            Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an <i>entire book</i> that
            answers your question, you&rsquo;re asking too much.
            </p>
            <p>
            If your motivation for asking the question is &ldquo;I would like to participate
            in a discussion about ______&rdquo;, then you should not be asking here. However, if your
            motivation is &ldquo;I would like others to explain ______ to me&rdquo;, then you
            are probably OK. (Discussions are of course welcome in our <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com">real time
            web chat</a>.)

        To prevent your question from being flagged <a href="#deletion">and possibly removed</a>, <b>avoid</b>
        asking subjective questions where &hellip;

        <ul>
            <li>every answer is equally valid: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favorite ______?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: &ldquo;I
                use ______ for ______, what do you use?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious if other people
                feel like I do.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: &ldquo;What if ______ happened?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>it is a rant disguised as a question: &ldquo;______ sucks, am I right?&rdquo;</li>

            When you post a new question, other users will almost immediately see it and try

            This lets other people know that you have received

            people will often politely ask you to go back and accept answers for more of your

            Reputation is a rough measurement of <span class="revision-comment">how much the community

            you&rsquo;re talking about. Basic use of the site, including asking questions, answering, and
            suggesting edits, does not require any reputation at all. But the more reputation you earn,
            the more <a href="/privileges">privileges</a> you gain on Stack Overflow
            .

            A maximum of <b>40</b>
            votes can be cast per user per day, however, to reach the maximum you must vote
            on at least
            10 questions. You can
            earn a maximum of <b>
                200</b> reputation per day. Please note that votes
            for posts marked &ldquo;community wiki&rdquo; do not generate any reputation, while accepted answers
            and bounty awards are not subject to the daily reputation limit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other way to gain reputation is by suggesting edits to existing posts as a new
            registered user. Each edit will be peer reviewed, and if it is accepted, you will
            earn <b>+2</b> reputation.
            You can only earn a maximum of <b>+1000</b>
            total reputation through suggested edits, however.

            To get better answers, you may need to put additional

            Document your own continued efforts to answer your question. This will

            There are a few other rules around bounties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Questions must be at least <b>2</b> days old to be eligible for a bounty. There can only be <b>1</b> active bounty per question at any given time.
            <li>Users must have at least <b>75</b> reputation to offer a bounty, and may only have a maximum of <b>3</b> active bounties at any given time.</li>
            <li>The bounty period lasts <b>7</b> days. Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least <b>1</b> day. After the bounty ends, there is a grace period of <b>24</b> hours to manually award the bounty.</li>
            <li>If you do not award your bounty within <b>7</b> days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer
                created <i>after the bounty started</i> with at least <b>2</b> upvotes will be
                awarded half the bounty amount. If there's no answer meeting that criteria, the bounty is not awarded to anyone.</li>
            <li>If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer <i>during the bounty period</i>, and the bounty expires without an explicit award &ndash; we assume the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In any case, you will <i>always</i> give up the amount of reputation specified in
            the bounty, so if you start a bounty, be sure to follow up and award your bounty to the best answer!
        </p>
        <p>
            As an additional bonus, bounty awards are immune to the daily reputation cap and
            community wiki mode.
